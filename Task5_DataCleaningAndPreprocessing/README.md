# Internship Applications Data Cleaning Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates a comprehensive data cleaning pipeline for internship application data. The dataset contains synthetic internship applications with realistic data quality issues commonly encountered in real-world scenarios.

## Objectives
- Ensure data accuracy by cleaning and transforming raw datasets
- Identify and handle missing values, duplicates, and outliers
- Standardize and structure data for efficient analysis
- Automate data cleaning using Python and Pandas

## Dataset Description
The synthetic dataset contains 1,500 internship applications with the following columns:
applicant_id - Unique identifier for each applicant
first_name, last_name - Applicant names with formatting issues
email - Email addresses with various format inconsistencies
phone_number - Phone numbers in multiple formats
university - Educational institution with inconsistencies
major - Field of study
gpa - Grade point average with outliers and missing values
graduation_year - Expected graduation year
application_date - Date of application in various formats
position_applied - Desired internship position
years_of_experience - Work experience with outliers
skills - Technical and soft skills
application_status - Current status of application
salary_expectation - Expected salary with extreme values
availability - Start date availability
resume_submitted - Boolean flag for resume submission
cover_letter - Boolean flag for cover letter
references_provided - Number of references provided

## Data Quality Issues Handled
### 1. Missing Values
GPA (~8% missing)
Years of experience (~7% missing)
Salary expectation (~9% missing)
Complete empty records (~3% of records)

### 2. Inconsistent Formatting
Names: Mixed case, trailing spaces
Emails: " at " instead of "@", various formats
Phone numbers: 4 different formats
Dates: Multiple date formats, invalid entries
Status: Mixed cases and inconsistent values

### 3. Data Type Issues
GPA: Mix of floats, strings, and out-of-range values
Boolean fields: Mixed types (True/False, 'Yes'/'No', 1/0)
Salary: Mix of numbers and text values

### 4. Duplicate Records
Exact duplicates (~5% of records)
Near-duplicates based on name/email matching

### 5. Outliers & Invalid Values
GPA: Values outside 0-4.0 range
Experience: Unrealistic values (20-50 years for interns!)
Salary: Extreme values ($100K-$500K for internships)

## Cleaning Pipeline Structure
### Phase 1: Structural Cleaning
Remove exact duplicates
Handle missing values strategically
Fix basic data types

### Phase 2: Content Standardization
Standardize text fields (names, emails, etc.)
Clean categorical variables
Fix date formats
Standardize phone numbers

### Phase 3: Validation & Enhancement
Handle outliers in numerical fields
Remove near-duplicates
Create derived features
Final quality validation
