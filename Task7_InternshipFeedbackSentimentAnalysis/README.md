# Internship Feedback Sentiment Analysis
A comprehensive sentiment analysis system for evaluating internship program feedback using Python, NLTK, and machine learning techniques.

## Project Overview
This project analyzes internship feedback data to evaluate emotional tones, identify improvement areas, and provide actionable insights for enhancing the internship experience. The system processes feedback from multiple sources and classifies sentiments as positive, neutral, or negative using advanced NLP techniques.

## Features
- **Data Generation**: Synthetic internship feedback dataset with realistic sentiment patterns
- **Sentiment Analysis**: NLTK-powered sentiment classification with VADER lexicon
- **Multi-dimensional Analysis**: Department-wise, source-wise, and experience-level insights
- **Interactive Dashboard**: Comprehensive KPI dashboard with visualizations
- **Actionable Recommendations**: Data-driven improvement suggestions
- **Trend Analysis**: Monthly and weekly sentiment pattern tracking

## Dataset Details
- The synthetic dataset contains 2,000+ internship feedback entries with the following features:
- Feedback Text: Realistic feedback comments
- Sentiment Labels: Positive, Neutral, Negative
- Departments: Data Science, Software Engineering, Marketing, UX Design, Business Analytics, Research
- Feedback Sources: Surveys, Social Media, Interviews, etc.
- Ratings: 1-5 scale correlated with sentiment
- Metadata: Experience levels, program duration, timestamps
