# Intern Performance Evaluation System
## Project Overview
A comprehensive data analytics solution for tracking, evaluating, and optimizing intern performance through automated KPI monitoring and reporting.
This system provides organizations with a robust framework to:
- Track intern performance across multiple dimensions
- Analyze key performance indicators (KPIs) automatically
- Generate comprehensive reports for management
- Predict future performance trends
- Optimize mentorship and task allocation

## Key Features
### 1. Multi-Dimensional Performance Tracking
- Task completion metrics
- Quality assessment scores
- Mentor feedback analysis
- Collaboration and initiative metrics

### 2. Automated KPI Monitoring
- Completion rates and timelines
- Quality consistency tracking
- Performance trend analysis
- Department-wise benchmarking

### 3. Intelligent Reporting
- Monthly performance dashboards
- Department comparison reports
- Individual progress tracking
- Predictive analytics

### 4. Data-Driven Insights
- Performance tier classification
- Early warning systems
- Optimization recommendations
- Strategic business insights

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)
### Core Metrics
- Completion Rate: Percentage of tasks completed on time
- Quality Score: Average quality rating (1-10 scale)
- Mentor Feedback: Supervisor evaluation scores
- Performance Score: Composite performance index (0-100)

### Secondary Metrics
- Task completion time
- Initiative and collaboration scores
- Learning assessment results
- Department-wise performance

## Analysis Modules
### 1. Performance Trends
- Monthly performance progression
- Growth trajectory analysis
- Consistency monitoring

### 2. Department Comparison
- Cross-department benchmarking
- Performance variance analysis
- Best practice identification

### 3. Mentor Impact
- Mentor effectiveness evaluation
- Consistency across mentors
- Workload distribution analysis

### 4. Task Efficiency
- Task type performance analysis
- Complexity vs completion time
- Quality consistency by task type

### 5. Predictive Analytics
- Performance prediction models
- Early risk identification
- Success probability scoring

## Output Reports
### Automated Reports Generated
- Comprehensive Performance Report (intern_performance_report.txt)
- Executive Summary (executive_summary.txt)
- Department-wise Analysis
- Individual Progress Reports
- Monthly Trend Dashboards

## Data Schema
### Monthly Performance Metrics
- intern_id: Unique identifier
- department: Department assignment
- month: Evaluation period
- completion_rate: Task completion percentage
- avg_quality_score: Quality assessment (1-10)
- mentor_feedback_score: Supervisor rating (1-10)
- monthly_performance_score: Composite score (0-100)

### Task Details
- task_id: Unique task identifier
- task_type: Category of task
- task_complexity: Difficulty level (1-5)
- actual_hours: Time taken
- quality_score: Task-specific quality rating
- completion_status: On-time/late/early completion

## Configuration
### Customizing KPIs
